Business Model / Product (Good)\\n\\t1. Both are good fintech/mobility, but Lendingkart has some really bad glassdoor reviews, and its looks more like a corporate (political thing), with less autonomy to do things..\\n\\t   \\n2. Good Work + Good Processes (okay)\\n\\t1. JVM/Node stack in both places.\\n\\t2. Chalo will have more scale compared to LendingKart because of B2C nature.\\n\\t   \\n3. Compensation.\\n\\t1.  Both are paying almost equally.\\n\\t   \\n4. Brand Name\\n5. WLB - Decent in both, learning towards Chalo.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Leaning towards Chalo a lot. With better scale, \\nand a good tech stack, Chalo looks like a closely-knit team.

Gave psuedo solution for O(log n) solution\\n* Log n solution: Computing for n=2^i\\n* For example you can compute for n=1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 etc\\n* To compute for n=2^i you need to have information about n=2^(i-1). You need to have how many possible count of n=2^(i-1) ends with 0,1 and 2 consecutive \\'L\\' start and 0,1 and 2 consecutive \\'L\\' end and also about how many of then have 0 and 1 absentes\\n* So n=2^i can be computed from n=2^(i-1) by using 16 steps((3+3)x2 first 3 comes from  0,1 and 2 consecutive \\'L\\' start next 3 comes from  0,1 and 2 consecutive \\'L\\' end and 2 comes from (0 or 1 absent)) \\n* Finally for n=5, you can use computations done for n=4 and n=1\\n* Similarly for n=10 use computations done for n=8 and n=2. \\n* Thus the main step is combining.\\n\\nRound 2:\\nThe questions asked were\\n1. https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-smaller-numbers-after-self/\\n2.

However, the initial offer was lower than what I wanted to settle for.\\n- The negotiation went on for long and in the end the HR said that they can not do better than 28,00,000.

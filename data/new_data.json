For coding, I did a lot of leetcode questions. I used to handle interviews at my previous company, so I know what interviewers look for and what I should not be doing. For example, talking through my thought process, asking questions to clarify if I don\\'t know something, testing my code without waiting for the interviewer to prompt etc.,\\n\\nFor system design, I did a few mocks online and watched a lot of videos. \\n\\nFor behavioral, because I used to work at FAANG before, I was able to apply some of the things around leadership. I was not asked general questions like how I handle conflicts etc., It was more about what I would do as VP of engineering and things like that. I didn\\'t specifically prepare for these kind of questions either. \\n\\n**Interview experience**\\nCoding questions were all medium level. For one, I had to write over 100 lines of code because I had to write all the APIs for a trie as well as the function to solve the problem using the trie. System design was generic as usual, gathered requirements and went from there.

Think of negotitating as another round where you have to use your communication skills to get a good offer, which means you should take some time to prepare for this along with technical and behavioral rounds. Here are some tips to negotiate for a better offer:\\n\\n1. Never accept the inital offer. There is always room for negotiation even if you do not hold any competing offers.\\n2. Be polite to your recruiter, they have to bat for you so that you can get a better offer.\\n2. Do some research on Leetcode to come up with the minimum amount acceptable to you.\\n3. When recruiter asks for expected salary, never mention the number. Always ask for the budget and use this no come up with your compensation. If they press you too much, ask 15% more than your minimum acceptable amount. You can also just tell them to give the best possible offer for the role.\\n4. If you are not happy with the numbers presented, do let them know that you are not happy with the offer and mention your achievements and how you would bring value into the organization to ask for more.\\n", "company": "Amazon", "role": "Sde1", "yoe": "9 Months", "salary": "Inr 22,00,000", "salaryTotal": ": ~ Inr 29,00,000", "city": "bangalore", "country": "india", "cleanYoe": 0.8, "cleanSalary": 2200000, "yrOrPm": "yearly", "cleanSalaryTotal": 2900000, "cleanCompany": "Amazon"}, {"id": "2139803", "title": "Twilio | Software engineer | L3 | Frontend", "voteCount": 1, "viewCount": 944, "date": "2022-06-12", "content": "Education: Btech Electrical Engineering Tier-3\\nYears of Experience: 5.5\\nPrior Experience: Service based\\nCurrent CTC: 14.2 + 1.5 ~ 15.5 lpa\\n\\nCompany: Twilio\\nTitle/Level: Software Engineer (L3)\\nLocation: Bangalore/WFH\\nBase Salary: 35 LPA\\nPF + gratuity - 2.35 lpa\\nSigning Bonus: 2.5 lacs + 3.75 lacs(one time)\\nStock bonus: $72000 vested over four years (quarterly) ~ 13.5 lpa\\nBonus: Relocation- $12k\\nWellbeing + WFH allowances - 2.16 lpa (18k per month)\\n\\nHad an offer of ~ 28 lpa", "company": "Twilio", "role": "Software Engineer (l3)", "yoe": "5.5", "salary": "35 Lpa", "salaryTotal": "", "city": "bangalore", "country": "india", "cleanYoe": 5.5, "cleanSalary": 3500000, "yrOrPm": "yearly", "cleanSalaryTotal": -1, "cleanCompany": "Twilio"}, {"id": "2138324", "title": "IndiaMART | Software Engineer | Noida | Offer", "voteCount": 0, "viewCount": 440, "date": "2022-06-11", "content": "Education: MTech CSE from top NIT\\nYears of Experience: 0 yrs\\nDate of the Offer: 2021\\nCompany: IndiaMART InterMESH Ltd.\\nTitle/Level: Software Engineer\\nLocation: Noida \\nSalary: INR 13 LPA\\nTotal comp (Salary + Bonus + Stock): ~INR 13LPA + Perf bonus\\nBenefits: Standard benefits like mediclaim, weekly salary disbursement", "company": "Indiamart Intermesh Ltd.", "role": "Software Engineer", "yoe": "0 Yrs", "salary": "Inr 13 Lpa", "salaryTotal": ": ~inr 13lpa + Perf Bonus", "city": "noida", "country": "india", "cleanYoe": 0.0, "cleanSalary": 1300000, "yrOrPm": "yearly", "cleanSalaryTotal": 1300000, "cleanCompany": "Indiamart"}, {"id": "2138252", "title": "OfBusiness | Software Engineer | Gurugram | 2022 Batch", "voteCount": 0, "viewCount": 269, "date": "2022-06-11", "content": "Education: B.Tech(Computer Science) from Tier-3 college\\nYears of Experience: 0\\nPrior Experience: Interned at a startup\\nDate of the Offer: May 2022\\nCompany: OfBusiness\\nTitle/Level: Software Engineer\\nLocation: Gurugram\\nSalary: 14 LPA\\nRelocation: 0\\nJoining Bonus: 1 LPA (after 3 months of probation period)\\nStock bonus: 6 Lakhs (20%, 20%, 30%, 30%)\\nTotal comp (Salary + Bonus + Stock): ~16.2LPA (first year)\\nBenefits: 30 paid leaves, Medical Insurance above CTC", "company": "Ofbusiness", "role": "Software Engineer", "yoe": "0", "salary": "14 Lpa", "salaryTotal": ": ~16.2lpa (first Year)", "city": "gurgaon", "country": "india", "cleanYoe": 0.0, "cleanSalary": 1400000, "yrOrPm": "yearly", "cleanSalaryTotal": 1620000, "cleanCompany": "Ofbusiness"}, {"id": "2137948", "title": "HSBC | Senior Consultant Specialist| Data Engineer | Pune", "voteCount": 0, "viewCount": 295, "date": "2022-06-11", "content": "Hey\\n\\nI Got offer from HSBC for Data Engineer Role / Big Data\\n\\nEducation: B.E\\nYears of Experience: 7 Years\\nCurrent Company: Impetus\\nCurrent CTC: 17 LPA\\n\\nCompany: HSBC\\nTitle/Level: SCS | Data Engineer\\nLocation: Pune\\nSalary: 27 LPA\\nBase - 25LPA\\nRelocation/Signing Bonus: None\\nStock bonus: None\\nBonus: None\\nTotal comp (Salary + Bonus + Stock): 27 LPA\\nBenefits: Standard Insurance Benefits\\n\\nIs this good offer or what all opportunities i can explore?\\nMaximum what can i expect?\\n", "company": "Hsbc", "role": "Scs", "yoe": "7 Years", "salary": "27 Lpa", "salaryTotal": ": 27 Lpa", "city": "pune", "country": "india", "cleanYoe": 7.0, "cleanSalary": 2700000, "yrOrPm": "yearly", "cleanSalaryTotal": 2700000, "cleanCompany": "Hsbc"}, {"id": "2137836", "title": "HCL Technologies | SDE Intern | Noida", "voteCount": 2, "viewCount": 449, "date": "2022-06-11", "content": "* Education: Tier 2 College (BTech.

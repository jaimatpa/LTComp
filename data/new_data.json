It started with a easy/easy-medium problem and then a followup question raised the difficulty bar to medium/medium-hard\\n* I realized it is very important to share your train of thoughts with the interviewer. The interviewer is looking for how you approach and make different trade-offs rather than directly vomiting out the answer\\n* Naming convention, comments, modularity will get you brownie points.  Dry run your solution for atleast one solid test case\\n* Prepare well with LC medium level questions. They helped me the most. I\\'ve only solved the ~50 hard questions (most of them with tears in my eyes)\\n\\nPreparation strategy summary :\\n* **Consistency is the key.**\\n* Refer the discuss section once you have solved the problem for alternate approach\\n* Do evaluate the complexity for the problems you have solved\\n* Focus on your weak areas rather than solving easy problems\\n* After an hour or so, if I was not able to crack the logic, I looked into the discuss for hints. (time mentioned here will vary from people to people)\\n* I did buy LC premium for a month but only solved ~30 premium problems. So regular free subscription of LC is more than enough\\n\\n----", "company": "Google", "role": "Software Engineer L3", "yoe": "1.8", "salary": "25 Lpa Base", "salaryTotal": ": \\ud83d\\ude34\\ud83d\\ude34 Too Lazy To Calcualte It, Can Someone Please Do It?
